    bigBang: `What was there before time itself came into being? No matter, no energy. Not even the absence of those things, for what could be absent from nothing itself.

    The most that can be said is that the nothing had potential, a capacity for what might come.
    
    Somehow, within that incomprehensible potential, nothing begot everything. Energy. Matter. Time. Everything that would ever exist. A hot dense pinpoint where even the fundamental forces were indistinguishable from each other, for a time.
    
    —
    
    Scientists from a small blue planet would one day discover a curious constraint of the universe. The tiniest duration of time that can be measured is about 10^-43 seconds. They would call the unit “Planck time”.
    
    From the moment nothing became everything, until the universe reached 1 Planck time in age, these scientists could only speculate about what things might have been like.
    
    —
    
    But something did happen at 1 Planck time. The universe expanded so much that the gravitational force spontaneously broke free from the other forces. With gravity separated from the other 3 fundamental forces, the universe expanded and cooled for a long time.
    
    —
    
    After about 10 million Planck times, or roughly 10^-36 seconds, something else happened. The universe had expanded and cooled enough that the strong nuclear force followed gravity’s lead, and broke free.
    
    This force would eventually be responsible for keeping atomic nuclei together, but during this time, the entire universe was the size of a proton, so no nucleus could have actually formed. 
    
    Nevertheless, when the strong nuclear force broke away, it triggered a phase of expansion called inflation. In a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a second, the universe grew to the size of a softball. Faster than the speed of light.
    
    —
    
    The universe continued to expand this way, and when it finally reached one trillionth of a second old, and the temperature dropped to a cool quadrillion degrees, the  weak nuclear force and the electromagnetic force finally separated from each other.
    
    —
    
    After one millionth of a second, the first protons and neutrons began to form and combine into Hydrogen nuclei. 
    
    After 3 minutes, Helium and Lithium nuclei followed.
    
    It would take ~300,000 years before the universe would be cold enough for nuclei to capture electrons and create proper atoms.
    
    And it would be at least another 30 million years of gravitational attraction to begin fusing these atoms into the first stars.`,
    cmb: `The universe left evidence of its birth. For about 300,000 years, it existed as a superheated plasma. Completely opaque. When it expanded and cooled enough, the plasma coalesced into atoms and the universe suddenly became transparent.

    Nearly 14 billion years later, scientists from the blue planet could "see" the energy that was released at that moment of transparency.
    
    An afterglow of primordial light. A projection from the hot early universe, permeating, spreading outward and inward, in every direction, and red-shifted into microwaves at the edge of the observable universe. 
    
    A light created even before the first stars formed, that would expand and slowly cool forever.`,
    nebulae: `The early universe produced massive clouds of primordial hydrogen and helium gas.

    Tiny variations in structure allowed hydrogen atoms to form molecular hydrogen, which in turn cooled the gas and a slight deviation in temperature allowed gravity to begin a long transformation.
    
    Enough mass in one place would cause hydrogen nuclei to collapse in on themselves and start a runaway fusion reaction, and a star would be born.
    
    The first nebulae were hot and dense, and the stars they produced were massive and bright.
    
    The next generation of stars would be born from nebulae containing heavier elements, metals, remnants from supernovae explosions of those first bright stars. Offspring that would themselves explode and provide more metals that would seed more nebulae and produce even newer stars.
    
    —
    
    This process would eventually create a yellow sun in one of the arms of a large spiral galaxy. From the perspective of the blue planet that orbited the sun, it was like being awash in a milky sky.
    
    Eventually, scientists from that planet would uncover the truth about their universe. The white milk was caused by the light of the abundance of stars in the plane of their galaxy. But, despite their desire for knowledge and understanding, scientists from that planet usually stuck to the names given by their ignorant and superstitious ancestors.`,
    abiogenesis: `There were hundreds of billions of stars in that galaxy, many of which looked like that particular sun. Circled by one or more rocky planets whose orbits were within the so-called "habitable zone".

    Their scientists would one day estimate that the Milky Way galaxy could contain as many as 6 billion such worlds. How was theirs different? Why did theirs produce life?
    
    —
    
    It was an admittedly myopic perspective, but the spontaneous creation of life, as they would come to understand it, needed many things:
    
    A surface with large bodies of water.
    
    A diversity of elements and complex molecules. 
    
    A magnetic field to let in certain types of energy from their sun while limiting its more harmful radiation and particles.
    
    An abundance of energy gradients; tide pools, volcanically heated salinated and fresh water. Energy for those chemicals to combine in interesting ways.
    
    And none of the scientists would ever know for sure, but probably a bit of luck. Whatever was actually required, their planet provided the necessary conditions.
    
    —
    
    The precursors of life were molecules that self-replicated and self-assembled.
    
    The molecules formed simple structures at first, but quickly grew in complexity. One type of molecule in particular was responsible for encoding how other molecules could be created and assembled.
    
    All life on that planet descended from one microscopic single-celled species. And billions of years of environmental hardship and competition for resources led to a vibrant explosion of biodiversity.
    
    Life found a way to exist and thrive in every nook and cranny on that planet.`,
    canopies: `Much of the species' early history was spent on their planet’s rocky surface. It was a combination of things that transformed their world, their home, into something almost totally uninhabitable. It was a true achievement to leave before they could annihilate themselves.`,
    sapience: `The blue planet produced one of only a few species capable of comprehending and contemplating their own existence, and their place within the universe. Plenty of archives exist from the time that their species was still struggling to leave their home world. Here is one such excerpt:

    —
    our minds elide the time, the flight of light, from distant galaxies
    the red-shifted wash arrives, a glaring sign of our reality
    
    we pushed beyond into the void
    we fled the paradise that we left destroyed
    
    we sang to the galaxy, radiating light
    that we might hear a voice, that we might share our plight
    but the void echoed back humanity’s own chorus
    and the stars shifted red and Nothing was for us
    
    we looked to the end of it all, and we found Nothing
    we looked to the end of it all, and we found Nothing
    we looked to the end of it all, and we are Nothing
    we looked to the end of it all, and we are Nothing
    we are Nothing
    we are Nothing
    we are Nothing
    we are Nothing

    After a time of suffering and hardship, they built ships and left, taking as many people and resources as they could afford to launch out of their planet's massive gravity well.
    
    They settled throughout their own solar system's planets and moons at first. Then they set their eyes on habitable worlds in nearby star systems.
    
    On an individual's scale their expansion was painfully slow. They never discovered a way around faster than light travel. Another of the universe's unbreakable constraints.
    
    Multi-generational ships traveled to the closest star systems. The people who launched in those ships understood they wouldn't live long enough to set foot on the world they were heading toward. But the ships would arrive in a dozen or so generations, and their descendants would be the first to walk on an alien world.
    
    Some made these foreign systems their home, and others, born into a culture of traveling among the stars, could only continue onward. A species slowly creeping through the arm of their spiral galaxy.
    
    Wherever they went, they settled or took what they needed. The raw material needed for their existence and expansion was abundant.
    
    —
    
    Isolated by unfathomable distances, they evolved and adapted. They made great discoveries. They even found simple lifeforms in many places. 
    
    But they never found another conscious mind, nor did they uncover a reason for their own existence. 
    
    Millenia passed. A billion millennia would pass before the species and their descendants would eventually die off, starved of energy and resources.
    
    They had predicted this fate. From the beginning, spacetime was expanding. The galaxies accelerated away from each other. The light from their stars shifted red and that was the proof.
    
    No matter how far they traveled from that blue planet, they were still trapped in their own galaxy.
    
    Their stars would eventually burn out and time would keep moving. Even if they survived trillions of years, it would only be a blip. All of humanity, all life that may have emerged in other parts of the universe, all of it would pale in comparison to the cold darkness at the end of time.
    
    Life was a transient peak. On a timeline with no end, it wouldn't be noticeable at all.
    
    At least, that's what they predicted.`,
    relentlessMarch: `One Planck time is 10^-43 seconds. It is the smallest duration of time that can be measured. 

    It could be said that the most interesting thing to ever happen in the universe, did so at a time when a sapient mind couldn’t possibly study it.
    
    Gravity is a curvature in spacetime. In the moment before gravity existed as a distinct force, it's difficult to know if time itself even behaved the way we can observe today.
    
    What is known is that within the first Planck time, everything that would ever exist and everything that would ever happen in the universe was set in motion.
    
    —
    
    The universe will expand forever, the stars will eventually burn through their fuel, and the night sky will become dark and cold.
    
    Black holes will remain for a long time. A timeline too massive to comprehend for a species born into such a young universe. But even the black holes will radiate away, evaporating into nothing. It will be 10^100 years or more for the largest ones.
    
    And for 10^1000 more years nothing will happen. During that time, the atoms of black dwarfs, the last cold remnants of the stars that didn’t become supernovae, will slowly fuse due to quantum effects. Eventually these black dwarfs will fuse enough of their atoms to collapse and explode. The least dense of these stars will take up to 10^10000 years.
    
    The collapse of the black dwarfs will be the last thing that ever happens in the universe, but time won’t stop there. It will wring out any remaining heat gradient. The universe will exist as a cold, mostly empty void, lightly sprinkled with dust and rocks.
    
    —
    A Planck time is dwarfed by the duration it took for the universe to produce the 4 distinct forces that govern its interactions.
    
    Which itself is dwarfed by the time to cool and form the first atoms.
    By the time for nebulae to ignite the first stars.
    For life to emerge.
    For intelligent species to expand to the edges of their galaxies. 
    For the stars to die. 
    For life to end. 
    For the black holes to evaporate. 
    For the black dwarfs to explode.
    For no heat to remain in the universe at all.
    
    But all of it is dwarfed by the time the universe will exist in that cold darkness. A time so long that, by comparison, even these incomprehensible durations are reduced to nothing.
    `,
    redShift: `Scientists from the blue planet could see it coming. Even before they left for the other stars in their galaxy.

    They had evolved to see a spectrum of electromagnetic radiation. Visible light. At one end of the spectrum, light was more energetic and had a shorter wavelength, and they called it "blue". At the other end of the spectrum, light was less energetic and had a longer wavelength, which they called "red".
    
    —
    
    ASIDE: Their eyes could detect these wavelengths long before they ever understood its physical properties as a wave. But "red" and "blue" were easier to remember than "700 nanometers" and "500 nanometers", so the simpler names stuck.
    
    —
    
    A curious property of waves is that their perceived energies (and hence their wavelengths) are affected by the relative velocity between emitter and observer.
    
    If the emitter and observer move closer together, from the observer's perspective, the wavelengths are more energetic. The waves crash into the observer at a faster rate, which makes light appear more blue than what was actually emitted. Scientists called this phenomenon a "blue shift".
    
    When the emitter and observer move away from each other, the opposite happens. The observer sees less energetic light. The waves crash less frequently, and light appears to be more red. Hence the name "red shift".
    
    —
    
    The scientists noted that light from other galaxies was redder than the light emitted by stars in their own galaxy. More than that, the light was even redder the greater the distance to the observed galaxy.
    
    The only explanation was that the galaxies were moving away from one another. Not only moving away, but *accelerating* away from one another. Space itself was expanding in the empty void between the stars, and stretching their light along with it.`,
    collapsingStar: `The brightest stars in the universe live the shortest lives, and die in the most spectacular way.

    Their massive gravity wells burn through their fuel, fusing heavier and heavier elements, until they contain a core of too much iron, the first element whose fusion energy is too large to keep the sun's furnace going. 
    
    The fusion reaction is at odds with the force of gravity. The massive energy output, preventing the sun from completely collapsing under its own weight. But the sudden loss of the fusion reaction causes the star's core to finally lose its battle against gravity, and it collapses and then explodes. The violence of this act is nearly unmatched by anything in the universe. 
    
    It's the fate of many large stars. But it's also part of a larger cycle. The supernova fuses heavier elements and sends its matter into nebulae as seeds for new stars.`,
    oneLastAlarm: `Some of the scientists from the blue planet were unsatisfied by the red shifted galaxies and the conclusion it led to. 

    Not that they didn't accept that the universe was expanding. That was an incontrovertible fact. 
    
    But what were the consequences of expanding space? Space exists everywhere, not just between galaxies. 
    
    Could the expansion of space overcome the gravitational attraction of stars within a galaxy?
    
    Some of them saw the end rapidly approaching. They didn't know when it would happen, only that it would.
    
    Some of them tried to prepare.
    
    Some of them thought it was preferable, compared to the cold dark infinite alternative.
    
    And some of them sounded the alarm, even though there was nothing they could do about it.`,
    spacetime: `First, the galaxies started disappearing. Space expanded and the light the galaxies sent our way began to be outpaced, pushing them outside our limited bubble of visible universe. Local starlight, produced by stars within their own galaxy, was all that existed for a long time.

    No one lived on the blue planet anymore, but their descendant's eyes watched from around the Milky Way. From one vantage point, near the center of the galaxy, stars at the galactic edge turned deep red. Slowly at first, and then the red crept toward them. 
    
    More and more stars accelerated outward as the space between them expanded. The stars at the edge began disappearing as they too left the visible universe. This happened long before we noticed that the light wasn’t reaching us anymore.
    
    After a short time, all that could be perceived by a pair of eyes orbiting a star, was the star system itself. 
    
    But space kept expanding. In an instant, the furthest planets disappeared. The star disappeared. The air became vacuum. And the bonds holding molecules together were overcome and split by that ever expanding space. Any life that could have existed in the universe was undone.
    
    And while that was the last moment a mind could perceive what was happening, it was not where it ended.
    
    Space expanded and pushed apart the nuclei of every atom in the universe. 
    
    It stretched waves of light into infinite flat lines.
    
    And it pushed apart time itself. 
    
    And just as they couldn't peer into that first Planck time of the universe, they couldn't have peered beyond the end of time either.`,
    whatHappensNow: `A mind operating within time can't perceive beyond those bounds. But the species from the blue planet faced all manner of incomprehensible things.

    Their curiosity never waned. 
    
    A nothingness that spontaneously created everything.
    
    A time so short and so close to creation that they couldn't be sure if time actually existed within it.
    
    A potential endless future.
    
    —
    
    Despite the loneliness and indifference in all they discovered, they still persisted. They still asked the questions they knew were impossible to answer. They still tried so hard to understand. And they still thought about what might be just beyond their perception.
    
    Maybe the end was the start of a new big bang and a new universe.
    
    Maybe a fifth fundamental force separated itself and the universe would inflate again and settle into a new type of equilibrium for a while. Maybe life could find a way to exist there.
    
    Maybe it was a simulation that served its purpose or reached its computational resource limit.
    
    Maybe the universe existed in some higher dimensional place. But what contained that place, and what contained *that* place, and so on?
    
    Maybe it was created by some deity. But why? And why were they so distant from their creation? Was it a test? A test for what?
    
    Maybe
    
    Maybe
    
    Maybe
    
    —
    
    Maybe it was a million things they could never understand.
    
    Maybe the beginning was just the beginning, and the end was just the end, and there was no more importance placed on it. 
    
    A chance happening. A fluke.
    
    But maybe it was still enough. An incomprehensible happenstance to be questioned and cherished all at once. Maybe they could live their short lives, faced with the existential loneliness of it all, and still think the fluke was beautiful.`,
