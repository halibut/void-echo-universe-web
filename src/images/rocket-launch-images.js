All four stages of the rocket are visible in this image.  Credit: NASA/Jamie Adkins  More info: On count day number 15, the Aural Spatial Structures Probe, or ASSP, was successfully launched on a NASA Oriole IV sounding rocket at 5:41 a.m. EST on Jan. 28, 2015, from the Poker Flat Research Range in Alaska. Preliminary data show that all aspects of the payload worked as designed and the principal investigator Charles Swenson at Utah State University described the mission as a “raging success.”   “This is likely the most complicated mission the sounding rocket program has ever undertaken and it was not easy by any stretch,&quot; said John Hickman, operations manager of the NASA sounding rocket program office at the Wallops Flight Facility, Virginia. &quot;It was technically challenging every step of the way.”  “The payload deployed all six sub-payloads in formation as planned and all appeared to function as planned.  Quite an amazing feat to maneuver and align the main payload, maintain the proper attitude while deploying all six 7.3-pound sub payloads at about 40 meters per second,&quot; said Hickman.

Through RockOn and RockSat-C students are learning and applying skills required to develop experiments for suborbital rocket flight.  In addition, middle school educators through the Wallops Rocket Academy for Teachers (WRATS) are learning about applying rocketry basics in their curriculum.  The payload flew to an altitude of 71.4 miles and descended by parachute into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Wallops.  Payload recovery is in progress.  The next launch from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility is a Black Brant IX suborbital sounding rocket currently scheduled between 6 and 10 a.m., July 7.

The evolution of the rocket to SLS Block 1B configuration with EUS enables SLS to launch 40% more cargo to the Moon along with the crew. Manufacturing both the core stage and Exploration Upper Stage is a collaborative effort between NASA and Boeing, the lead contractor for EUS and the SLS core stage. SLS is the only rocket that can send Orion, astronauts, and supplies to the Moon in a single mission. The SLS rocket, NASA’s Orion spacecraft, Gateway, and human landing system are part of NASA’s backbone for deep space exploration.
