The site's 4205 m elevation, and lack of light pollution make it one of the most ideal locations for astronomical observations. Start of construction of the new Thirty Meter Telescope was delayed in July due to protests by Native Hawaiians who consider the mountain to be one of their most sacred sites. Image data for the perspective view was acquired April 23, 2019, and is located at 19.8 degrees north, 155.5 degrees west.  https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA23339","thumb":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA23339/PIA23339~thumb.jpg"},{"nasaId":"0102016","title":"Skylab","date":"1973-09-01T00:00:00Z","center":"MSFC","description":"This Earth Resource Experiment Package (EREP) photograph of the Uncompahgre area of Colorado was electronically acquired in September of 1973 by the Multi-spectral Scarner, Skylab Experiment S192. EREP images were used to analyze the vegetation conditions and landscape characteristic of this area. Skylab's Earth sensors played the dual roles of gathering information about the planet and perfecting instruments and techniques for future satellites and manned stations. An array of six fixed cameras, another for high resolution, and the astronauts' handheld cameras photographed surface features. Other instruments, recording on magnetic tape, measured the reflectivity of plants, soils, and water. Radar measured the altitude of land and water surfaces. The sensors' objectives were to survey croplands and forests, identify soils and rock types, map natural features and urban developments, detect sediments and the spread of pollutants, study clouds and the sea, and determine the extent of snow and ice cover.

In the north, the large city of Beijing is completely obscured from view, as is much of the landscape. The haze thins slightly over the Bohai Sea. Further south, sediment pours into the East China Sea near the city of Shanghai.  Heavy haze is common in this region, and tends to worsen in October through January, when cold, heavy air traps pollutants near the surface of the Earth. It is likely that this scene was caused by such a temperature inversion. Normally, air is warmest near the surface of the Earth. But sometimes a mass of warm air will move the cooler air, so the atmosphere actually warms with the altitude. Cool air does not have energy to rise through the warm air, vertical circulation slows and air becomes trapped near the surface. Any pollution that is emitted into the cooler air will also get trapped, increasing low-level air pollution and haze.

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the Terra satellite captured this true-color image on December 23.  The dense, gray haze obscures almost all the land and much of the coastal waters from view south and east of the Taihang Mountains. Clearer air covers the region north of the mountains, although fingers of haze roll through most river valleys. The cities of Beijing and Hebei, both west of the Bohai Sea are complete enshrouded.  By December 24 the smog levels in some area exceeded World Health Organization-recommended levels by 30 times, according to Bloomberg News. The concentration of PM2.5, which are fine air particulates, were reported at 421 micrograms per cubic meter at 2 p.m. near Tiananmen Square in Beijing, while levels were 795 in Xi’an and 740 in Zhengzhou. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends 24-hour exposure to PM2.5 concentrations no higher than 25 micrograms per cubic meter.  While not the sole cause of haze and pollution, the use of coal as a very cheap energy source adds to the problem, particularly north of the Huai River. Prior to 1980, the government policy provided free coal for fuel boilers for all people living north of the Huai River. The widespread use of coal allows people in the north to stay warm in winter, but they have paid a price in air quality.  According to Michael Greenstone, a Professor of Environmental Economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), whose research team published a paper on sustained exposure to air pollution on life expectancy in the region, air pollution, as measured by total suspended particulates, was about 55% higher north of the Huai River than south of it, for a difference of around 184 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter. The research, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in July, 2013, also noted life expectancies were about 5.5 years lower in the north, owing to an increased incidence of cardiorespiratory mortality.  Air pollution is an on-going issue for the government of China, and Beijing’s Five-Year Clean Air Action Plan aims to reduce overall particle density by over 25 percent on the PM2.5 scale by 2017, and also takes aim at shutting down all coal-burning plants.
