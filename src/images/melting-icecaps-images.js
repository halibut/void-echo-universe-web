The research could help predict how much the Greenland Ice Sheet will contribute to future sea level rise in the next century, a number that currently ranges from inches to feet.  “There are glaciers that popped up in our study that flew under the radar until now,” said lead author Denis Felikson, a graduate research assistant at The University of Texas Institute for Geophysics (UTIG) and a Ph.D. student in The University of Texas Department of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics. Felikson’s study was published in Nature Geoscience on April 17.

The traditional view on ice shelves, the floating extensions of seaward glaciers, has been that they mostly lose ice by shedding icebergs. A new study by NASA and university researchers has found that warm ocean waters melting the ice sheets from underneath account for 55 percent of all ice shelf mass loss in Antarctica. This image was taken during the 2012 Antarctic campaign of NASA's Operation IceBridge, a mission that provided data for the new ice shelf study.

We know this from basic physics. When water heats up, it expands. So when the ocean warms, sea level rises. When ice is exposed to heat, it melts. And when ice on land melts and water runs into the ocean, sea level rises.  For thousands of years, sea level has remained relatively stable and human communities have settled along the planet’s coastlines. But now Earth’s seas are rising. Globally, sea level has risen about eight inches since the beginning of the 20th century and more than two inches in the last 20 years alone.  All signs suggest that this rise is accelerating.

The brown water in front of the glacier is caused by sediment being dredged up from the base of the glacier by meltwater plumes reaching the surface of the fjord.  Because the meltwater contains no salt, it is lighter and rises through the saltier ocean water, dragging the warm ocean water into contact with the ice at the glacier's base. The result is increased melting at the bottom of the glacier, which creates and overhanging layer of ice that breaks off (or calves) as icebergs. As the climate warms, the ocean water temperature and the amount of meltwater both increase, combining to hasten this undercutting process and speed up the ice loss from Greenland's Ice Sheet.  The image was taken on Aug. 25, 2019 by a probe-dropping airplane as part of the Oceans Melting Greenland (OMG) mission. OMG has been studying glaciers that plunge into Greenland's steep-sided inlets, or fjords, for the past five years, gathering precise measurements of fjord depth and water salinity from probes dropped by plane, supplemented by measurements made by boat. The aim is to better understand how the warming ocean water around Greenland is hastening ice melt and calving of these marine-terminating glaciers.  https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA24162","thumb":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA24162/PIA24162~thumb.jpg"},{"nasaId":"GSFC_20171208_Archive_e000213","title":"NASA's Observes Effects of Summer Melt on Greenland Ice Sheet","date":"2017-12-08T00:00:00Z","center":"GSFC","description":"NASA's IceBridge, an airborne survey of polar ice, flew over the Helheim/Kangerdlugssuaq region of Greenland on Sept. 11, 2016.

IceBridge completed the final flight of the summer campaign to observe the impact of the summer melt season on the ice sheet on Sept. 16.  The IceBridge flights, which began on Aug. 27, are mostly repeats of lines that the team flew in early May, so that scientists can observe changes in ice elevation between the spring and late summer. For this short, end-of-summer campaign, the IceBridge scientists flew aboard an HU-25A Guardian aircraft from NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia.
