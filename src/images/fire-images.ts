      "NASA’s Suomi NPP satellite detected thousands of fires burning in central Africa on July 11, 2016. The fires are represented by the multitudes of red dots. Most of the fires burn in grass or cropland. The location, widespread nature, and number of fires suggest that these fires were deliberately set to manage land.  Places where traditional plots of open land is not available because the vegetation in the area is dense are the places where &quot;slash and burn&quot; agriculture is practiced most often. These regions include parts of Africa, northern South America, and Southeast Asia, where an abundance of grasslands and rainforests are found.  Although most parts of the world outlaw this type of agriculture due to the fact that the smoke from these (or any) fires is a health hazard, the method of agriculture continues because it is the easiest and lowest cost solution to clearing fields for next year's crops.  The Suomi NPP satellite is a joint mission between NASA, NOAA and the U.S. Department of Defense.  NASA image courtesy Jeff Schmaltz, MODIS Rapid Response Team.",

    description:
      'Fires both wild and prescribed dot the landscape of the southeastern portion of the United States.  Wildfires are those that occur naturally with lightning strikes or are set by careless humans.  Prescribed fires are those deliberately set by land management authorities to take out underlying brush and dead grass so that in the event of a wildfire there is not sufficient fuel for that fire to spread too far.  The Southern Area Coordination Center for fire management has this information on its report for February 21, 2017.  • Fires that have broken out recently (known as Initial Attack Activity):  198 fires for 2,292 acres • Ongoing Uncontained Large Fires:  3 fires for 5,947 acres • Other Fires reported through alternate channels:  56 fires for 1,400 acres  • Prescribed Fire Activity: State and/or Federal Lands – 1,974 prescribed fires for 38,533 acres in AL, FL &amp; GA  The bulk of the fires seen in the image taken by the Aqua satellite using the onboard MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) instrument on February 16, 2017 appear to be prescribed fires.  Actively burning areas, detected by MODIS’s thermal bands, are outlined in red and when combined with smoke are indicative of fire.

In this color infrared composite, vegetation is red, clouds are white, and smoke from forest fires is blue. An enlargement (Figure 1) covers an area of 12 x 15 km. A thermal infrared band is displayed in red, a short wave infrared band is displayed in green, and a visible band is displayed in blue. In this combination, fires larger than about 50 m appear yellow because they are bright in both infrared bands. Smaller fires appear green because they are too small to be seen by the 90 m thermal pixels, but large enough to be detected in the 30 m short wave infrared pixels. We are able to see through the smoke in the infrared bands, whereas in the visible bands, the smoke obscures detection of the active fires.

    description:
      'The winter of 2013 was among the driest on record for California, setting the stage for an active fire season. By August 26, the Rim Fire had made its way into the record books. At just 15 percent contained, the fire is now the 13th largest in California since records began in 1932. Apart from being large, the fire is also threatening one of the United States’ greatest natural treasures: Yosemite National Park.  The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi NPP satellite tracked the growth of the fire between August 23 and August 26 in a series of nighttime images. The VIIRS day-night band is extremely sensitive to low light, making it possible to see the fire front from space. The brightest, most intense parts of the fire glow white, exceeding the brightness of the lights of Reno, Nevada to the north. Pale gray smoke streams north away from the fire throughout the sequence.  The perimeter of the fire grows from day to day along different fronts, depending on winds and fire fighting efforts. On August 24, fire fighters focused their efforts on containing the western edge of the fire to prevent it from burning into Tuolumne City and the populated Highway 108 corridor. They also fought the eastern edge of the fire to protect Yosemite National Park. These efforts are evident in the image: Between August 23 and 24, the eastern edge of the fire held steady, and the western edge receded. The fire grew in the southeast.  On the morning of August 25 fire managers reported that the fire was growing in the north and east. In the image, the most intense activity is just inside Yosemite National Park.  Fire fighters reported that the Rim Fire continued to be extremely active on its eastern front on the morning of August 26, and this activity is visible in the image. By 8:00 a.m., the fire had burned 149,780 acres. The fire forced firefighters in Yosemite National Park to take measures to protect the Merced and Tuolumne Groves of Giant Sequoias, but the National Park Service reported that the trees were not in imminent danger. While parts of the park are closed, webcams show that most of the park has not been impacted.  The Rim Fire started on the afternoon of August 17. It has destroyed 23 structures and threatened 4,500 other buildings. Its cause is under investigation.

      'Eight major wildfires burned through forests and grasslands in the Pacific Northwest in late-July 2013, threatening homes and forcing road closings and evacuations. Many parts of Washington and Oregon faced extreme fire threats, as strong thunderstorms lined up to hit parched forests and grasslands with lightning.  On July 28, 2013, the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat 8 captured these images of the Mile Marker 28 fire in the Simcoe Mountains northeast of Goldendale, Washington. Smoke blew east toward Kennewick, Pasco, and Richland. The lower image shows a closer view of smoke billowing up from the most active part of the fire.  Ignited on July 24, 2013, the fire charred more than 22,000 acres (8,900 hectares) by July 30, when more than 1,000 firefighters achieved 40 percent containment. The blaze forced the evacuation of dozens of homes and the closure of US Highway 97.  Through July 25, 450 wildfires had burned 10,220 acres (4,136 hectares) in Washington, while Oregon saw 603 fires that burned 63,135 acres (25,549 hectares). In all, 2.3 million acres burned across the United States by late-July, below the national average. Over the past ten years, an average of 4.2 million acres had burned in the United States by the end of each July.  While coastal and western Washington receive heavy rain throughout the year, the rain shadow caused by the Cascades leaves central Washington quite dry. The mountains force moist air from the Pacific to rise, causing it to cool and condense into rain or snow on the windward side of the Cascades. So little moisture is left by the time air passes over the Cascades, that the area around Mile Marker 28 typically receives just 8 inches (20 centimeters) of precipitation per year.

      'The single fire that ignited and split into nine separate fires still blazes in Southern California today. Firefighters are hoping for a break today (Thursday, May 15, 2014) but it doesn\'t look like luck may be on their side.  Conditions continue to be bone dry with unseasonal heat (98-106 degrees) and the Santa Ana winds are kicking up and allowing these fires to easy jump fire lines.  This particular fire started on Wednesday as a single fire and within a day is now nine separate fires which have burned close to 10,000 acres.  These fires are threatening more than just landscape in San Diego county, they are also threatening homes, universities, a military base and a nuclear power plant.   Day Two of the fires have seen them already destroying dozens of homes and forcing tens of thousands to evacuate.  Camp Pendleton has also been partially evacuated due to the blazes as has the popular amusement park, Legoland.  The Governor of California has declared a state of emergency.  Thousands of firefighters are battling the flames both on the ground and in the air.  Seven tankers and 20 military aircraft are also assisting the firefighters with their mission.   Temperatures soaring over 100 degrees coupled with 30 mph wind gusts have severely hampered the efforts, however, and fire tornadoes have broken out.  Fire tornadoes are caused by crosswinds that create a vortex and produce winds that twist and swirl just like a tornado but with flames that coil upwards in the center of the twister creating a terrifying specter.   Although there is no chance of rain in the area for the next several days, the temperatures will start to subside on Friday and into the weekend.  Winds are also expected to start to subside, giving firefighters that break that they so desperately need.

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument that flies aboard NASA\'s Aqua satellite captured an image of smoke from these fires Aug. 2 at 21:05 UTC (5:05 p.m. EDT). The multiple red pixels are heat signatures detected by MODIS. The smoke appears to be a light brown color.  InciWeb is an interagency all-risk incident information management system that coordinates with federal, state and local agencies to manage wildfires.  In Oregon smoke from the Cable Crossing Fire, the Stouts Fire and the Potter Mountain Complex Fire commingle. The Cable Crossing Fire was reported burning on forestlands protected by the Douglas Forest Protective Association (DFPA) at approximately 3:25 p.m. on Tuesday, July 28, 2015, near Oregon Highway 138 East, near Mile Post 23, east of Glide.  South of the Cable Crossing Fire is the Stouts Fire also in forestlands of the DFPA. This fire was reported on Thursday, July 30, 2015, burning approximately 11 miles east of Canyonville near the community of Milo.  East of the other fires is the Potter Mountain Complex Fire. These fires are located in the Deschutes Forest consists of eight fires. According to Inciweb they were started by dry lightning on Saturday, Aug. 2, at approximately 5:30 p.m. about five miles north of Toketee Lake.  In northern California, smoke from the River Complex Fire, the Fork Complex Fire and the Shf July Lightning Fire was visible in the MODIS image.  The River Complex currently consists of seven reported and observed fires on the Six Rivers and Shasta Trinity National Forests. Originally identified as 18 fires, some have burned together. Inciweb noted that in the Six Rivers National Forest there are fires in the Trinity Alps Wilderness. Those fires include the Groves Fire and the Elk Fire. In the Shasta-Trinity National Forest the fires include the Happy Fire at 2,256 acres, Daily Fire at 16 acres, the Look Fire at 7 acres, Onion Fire at 136 acres and Smokey Fire at 1 acre.  In the same forest, south of the River Complex is the Fork Complex fire. Inciweb reported that the Fork Complex consists of (at current count) over 40 fires, all of which were ignited by lightning between July 29 and 31, 2015. To the southwest of this complex is the Mad River Complex. This is a series of seven lightning fires that started on July 30, 2015 after a lightning storm moved through Northern California.  To the east of this and the other fires, burns another near Redding, California, called the Shf July Lightning Fire. This is also under the Shasta-Trinity National Forest management.

      "In southwest Oregon, the Biscuit Fire continues to grow. This image, acquired from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) on NASA's Terra satellite on August 14, 2002, shows the pillars of smoke arising from the fires. Active fire areas are in red. More than 6,000 fire personnel are assigned to the Biscuit Fire alone, which was 390,276 acres as of Thursday morning, August 15, and only 26 percent contained. Among the resources threatened are thousands of homes, three nationally designated wild and scenic rivers, and habitat for several categories of plants and animals at risk of extinction. Firefighters currently have no estimate as to when the fire might be contained.  http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA03856",
