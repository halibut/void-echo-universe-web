Scientists say the planet may be entirely covered in lava. The planet is so close to its star that one face of the planet consistently faces the star, resulting in a dayside and a nightside.   https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA22069","thumb":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA22069/PIA22069~thumb.jpg"},{"nasaId":"PIA20690","title":"Exoplanet Orbits Youthful Star (Artist Concept)","date":"2016-06-20T14:45:01Z","center":"JPL","description":"K2-33b, shown in this illustration, is one of the youngest exoplanets detected to date using NASA Kepler Space Telescope.  It makes a complete orbit around its star in about five days.  These two characteristics combined provide exciting new directions for planet-formation theories. K2-33b could have formed on a farther out orbit and quickly migrated inward. Alternatively, it could have formed in situ, or in place.   http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA20690","thumb":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA20690/PIA20690~thumb.jpg"},{"nasaId":"PIA22087","title":"WASP-18b (Artist's Concept)","date":"2017-11-29T00:00:00Z","center":"JPL","description":"WASP-18b is an exoplanet located 325 light-years from Earth. The planet's mass is 10 times that of Jupiter, and it orbits its star once every 23 hours.  A 2017 study found that this planet has a stratosphere that's loaded with carbon dioxide, but has no signs of water. A stratosphere is a layer of atmosphere in which temperature increases with higher altitudes. The study used NASA's Spitzer and Hubble space telescopes.  https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA22087","thumb":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA22087/PIA22087~thumb.jpg"},{"nasaId":"PIA22098","title":"TRAPPIST-1 Planet Animations","date":"2018-02-05T00:00:00Z","center":"JPL","description":"This still from a video shows illustrations of the seven Earth-size planets of TRAPPIST-1, an exoplanet system about 40 light-years away, based on data current as of February 2018. Each planet is shown in sequence, starting with the innermost TRAPPIST-1b and ending with the outermost TRAPPIST-1h. The video presents the planets' relative sizes as well as the relative scale of the central star as seen from each planet. The art highlights possibilities for how the surfaces of these intriguing worlds might look based on their newly calculated properties.  The seven planets of TRAPPIST-1 are all Earth-sized and terrestrial. TRAPPIST-1 is an ultra-cool dwarf star in the constellation Aquarius, and its planets orbit very close to it.  In the background, slightly distorted versions our familiar constellations, including Orion and Taurus, are shown as they would appear from the location of TRAPPIST-1 (backdrop image courtesy California Academy of Sciences/Dan Tell).

The planet was first discovered in 2007 at the Gemini North observatory. It was identified in the NICMOS archival data in a follow-up search of NICMOS archival data to see if Hubble had also serendipitously imaged it.  The planet is young and hot, at a temperature of 1500 degrees Fahrenheit. It is slightly larger than Jupiter and may be at least seven times more massive. Analysis of the NICMOS data suggests the planet has water vapor in its atmosphere and is only partially cloud covered. It is not known if the planet has rings or moons, but circumplanetary debris is common among the outer planets of our solar system.  Credit: NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center/ESA/G.
