Looking inward from the system outer fringes, a ring of dusty debris can be seen, and within it, planets circling a star the size of our Sun.  This debris is all that remains of the planet-forming disk from which the planets evolved. Planets are formed when dusty material in a large disk surrounding a young star clumps together. Leftover material is eventually blown out by solar wind or pushed out by gravitational interactions with planets. Billions of years later, only an outer disk of debris remains.  These outer debris disks are too faint to be imaged by visible-light telescopes. They are washed out by the glare of the Sun. However, NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope can detect their heat, or excess thermal emission, in infrared light. This allows astronomers to study the aftermath of planet building in distant solar systems like our own.  http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07096","thumb":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA07096/PIA07096~thumb.jpg"},{"nasaId":"PIA21475","title":"Brown Dwarf Weather (Artist's Concept)","date":"2017-06-06T00:00:00Z","center":"JPL","description":"This artist's concept shows what the weather might look like on cool star-like bodies known as brown dwarfs.

New research using Cassini radar data and modeling proposes that lake basins like these are likely explosion craters, which could have formed when liquid molecular nitrogen deposits within the crust warmed and quickly turned to vapor, blowing holes in the moon's crust. This would have happened during a warming event (or events) that occurred in a colder, nitrogen-dominated period in Titan's past. The new research may provide evidence of these cold periods in Titan's past, followed by a relative warming to conditions like those of today. Although Titan is frigid compared to Earth, methane in the atmosphere provides a greenhouse effect that warms the moon's surface.  https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA23172","thumb":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA23172/PIA23172~thumb.jpg"},{"nasaId":"PIA22745","title":"InSight - Artist's Illustration","date":"2018-10-30T00:00:00Z","center":"JPL","description":"An artist illustration of the InSight lander on Mars.
