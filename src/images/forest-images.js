The image is 10 kilometers by 25 kilometers (6 miles by 15.5 miles) and is centered at approximately 44.3 degrees north latitude and 3 degrees east longitude. This image was acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar aboard the space shuttle Endeavour on April 15, 1994 and on October 6, 1994. The image channels have the following color assignments: red was acquired in April; green was acquired in October; and blue is the ratio of the two data sets combined. Seasonal differences in the vegetation are visible in pink, which are heaths growing in the spring.  This research area features two large limestone plateaus cut by the famous Gorges du Tarn, standing in parallel with the granite mountain range known as the Cevennes Mountains nearby. Land-use consists mainly of grasslands, heaths and forests. Forest types seen in the images are Austrian pines,Scots pines, spruce, fir and beech trees. Most forests were planted at the end of the 19th century through a national reforestation program aimed at reducing the strong erosion risks in these areas. This program was so successful that today the forests are exploited for forest pulpwood and sawlogs, but also remain protected as conservation regions. The study being performed in this area will assess the potential of spaceborne radar remote sensing for temperate forest type mapping and forest resource monitoring. The combination of X-band SAR data with lower frequency data (such as the SIR-C L-band data) allows scientists to distinguish forest tree species and biomass, or areas of ground vegetation.  The lessons learned from the radar images of these controlled forest regions can be applied to larger areas and naturally grown forests to help ecologists protect and maintain them. The SIR-C/X-SAR images will be investigated by scientists from the remote sensing laboratory Cemagref in Montpellier and the National Forestry Board in Mende, France.   http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA01755","thumb":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA01755/PIA01755~thumb.jpg"},{"nasaId":"sts046-75-79a","title":"Mt.

The area is located 40 kilometers (25 miles) north and 30 kilometers (20 miles) east of the town of Prince Albert in the Saskatchewan province of Canada.  The image covers the area east of the Candle Lake, between gravel surface Highways 120 and 106 and west of 106.  The area in the middle of the image covers the entire Nipawin (Narrow Hills) provincial park.  The look angle of the radar is 30 degrees and the size of the image is approximately 20 kilometers by 50 kilometers (12 by 30 miles).  The image was produced by using only the L-Band.  The three polarization channels HH, HV and VV are illustrated by red, green and blue respectively.  The changes in the intensity of each color are related to various surface conditions such as variations in forest stands, frozen or thawed condition of the surface, disturbances (fire and deforestation), and areas of re-growth.  Most of the dark areas in the image are the ice-covered lakes in the region.  The dark area on the top right corner of the image is the White Gull Lake north of the intersection of Highway 120 and 913.  The right middle part of the image shows Lake Ispuchaw and Lower Fishing Lake.  The deforested areas are also shown by dark areas in the image.  Since most of the logging practice at the Prince Albert area is around the major highways, the deforested areas can be easily detected as small geometrically shaped dark regions along the roads.  At the time of the SIR-C/X-SAR overpass, a major part of the forest is either frozen or undergoing the spring thaw.  The L-Band HH shows a high return in the jack pine forest.  The reddish areas in the image are old jack pine forest, 12-17 meters (40-55 feet) in height and 60-75 years old.  The orange-greenish areas are young jack pine trees, 3-5 meters (10-16 feet) in height and 11-16 years old.  The green areas are due to the relative high intensity of the HV channel which is strongly correlated with the amount of biomass.  L-Band HV channel shows the biomass variations over the entire region.  Most of the green areas, when compared to the forest cover maps are identified as black spruce trees.
