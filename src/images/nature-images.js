The agency is nearing completion on a restoration project to shore up the dunes that create a natural barrier from the waves. Once the dune is built up, native coastal vegetation will be replanted, helping to stabilize the dune and offer a habitat for Kennedy’s coastal wildlife.","thumb":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/KSC-20201028-PH-JBS02_0013/KSC-20201028-PH-JBS02_0013~thumb.jpg"},{"nasaId":"KSC-20161213-PH_SWW01_0010","title":"Nature Photography - Bald Eagles","date":"2016-12-13T00:00:00Z","center":"KSC","description":"An American bald eagle soars through the air above NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
