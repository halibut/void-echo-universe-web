# EVERYTHING

EVERYTHING is a concept album about the universe, time, and existential dread. This project is a visualizer
for the album, which you can experience here: [EVERYTHING](https://everything.voidechomusic.com)

Use chrome for the best experience. There are a lot of inconsistencies in the way browser sound APIs work, and since this was a hobby/personal project
I only had time to focus on Chrome. It should theoretically work on other browsers, but YMMV.

## What is this for?

Mostly for fun. I'm a professional software engineer by day, but an amateur electronic music producer by night. This is my first full length album,
and I wanted to make something interesting to support its release.

## Who is this for?

The website is for anyone. This repo is for people who want to see what React, the browser sound APIs, and a bit of CSS can all do together.
